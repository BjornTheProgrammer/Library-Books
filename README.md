# Library-Books
A simple plugin, which allows you to easily add books into your Minecraft server.

# Building the Plugin
Just run compile.sh, having the java SDK installed via the command `./compile.sh`, then grab the `Library.jar` file which is now generated in this directory, and install by adding to your server's `plugins/` folder.
